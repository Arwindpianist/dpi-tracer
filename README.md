# Mouse DPI Tracer

This is a simple website that estimates the DPI range of a user's mouse based on their movements while tracing a shape on the screen. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed through a web browser.

## How it Works

When a user visits the website, they will be prompted to select their mouse category - regular, gaming, or professional. After selecting their mouse category, they will be presented with a screen that displays a simple shape, such as a circle or square, at a specific size on the screen.

The user will then be asked to move their mouse to trace the shape as accurately as possible. As they do so, the website will track their mouse movements and record data such as the distance moved and the time taken.

Based on the data collected, the website will estimate the user's mouse DPI range by using a formula to calculate the DPI based on the movement distance and time taken to complete the trace. The website will then display an estimated DPI range for the user's mouse based on the data collected and the user's mouse category.

It's important to note that the accuracy of the estimated DPI range will depend on various factors, such as the user's mousepad surface, the mouse's sensor quality, and the user's own precision when tracing the shape. Nonetheless, the website can provide a useful estimation for users who are curious about their mouse DPI range.

## How to Use

1. Open a web browser and go to the [website URL](https://arwindpianist.github.io/dpi-tracer/).
2. Select your mouse category - regular, gaming, or professional.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to trace the shape as accurately as possible.
4. After tracing the shape, the website will display an estimated DPI range for your mouse based on the data collected and your mouse category.
